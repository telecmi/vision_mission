# TeleCMI

**TeleCMI** is an innovative cloud telephony provider that helps businesses streamline their customer communications through voice, SMS, WhatsApp, and AI-powered interactions. Initially launched in 2016 with PSTN calling due to India’s VoIP regulations, we now leverage our VNO license to deliver end-to-end VoIP solutions and WebRTC-based services. Beyond traditional phone calls, our platform includes advanced AI capabilities—such as real-time transcription, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text—enabling efficient, omni-channel customer engagement.

We’re continually expanding with products like **PIOPIY** for AI call handling and **Connly AI** for multi-channel agent collaboration, all aimed at empowering organizations to connect better and grow faster in India and globally.
